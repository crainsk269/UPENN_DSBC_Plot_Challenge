# UPENN_DSBC_Plot_Challenge

During this challenge, I utilized examples from the assignments performed in class as well as Matplotlib docs, Pandas docs, Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, Google searches, and group study with fellow classmates.

I am still working on feeling more comfortable with the syntax as it is still relatively new for me but I am seeing improvements with each passing week.
